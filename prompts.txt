I am going to create a seat_prediction project for a college... this is a django project, consider yourself a pro django developer and i want you to be my assistant in this project...
i have 5 routes in this project, 

auth/login and auth/register which are basic login and register routes...with separate auth_app....

and api/predict where the user will enter certain details like name of the student,
date of birth, mobile number, gender, email id, religion, class 12th marks(the user will enter out of 500/600 i want it to be converted to percentage),
course(chosen between pcm, pcb,pcmb), stream(chosen between science/commerce and arts), degree(chosen between bsc,bca,b.a,bcom, bba),
category(chosen between general,obc,sc,st,mbc,bcm)...... and then there will be predict button upon clicked the ai logic will run and the response should be fetched.. 
i will write the ai logic later, now just randomly give the result as percentage of getting selected for that seat... i will replpace it with my ai logic later.. 
give appropriate django code files first give me file structure then ask me for next and we can oriceed steo by step...
